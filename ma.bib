Thus it might seem that Scrum, the Agile process often used for software development, would not be appropriate for hardware development. However, most of the obvious differences between hardware and software development have to do with the nature and sequencing of deliverables, rather than unique attributes of the work that constrain the process. The research conducted for this paper indicates that a Scrum process is quite appropriate for hardware development. Thus this paper describes a practical Agile process for Agile hardware development, which is almost identical to the Scrum process as it is commonly used for developing software.},

Using a participantlobserver perspective, 1 examine how scenario planning tries to meet certain methodological, organizational and psychological challenges facing today's senior managers. Three prime characteristics are identified as setting the scenario approach apart from more traditional planning tools: (I) the script or narrative approach, (2) uncertainty across rather than within models, and (3) the decomposition of planning, I examine such organizational aspects as the need for diversity of views and the a complex future into discrete states. After exploring the intellectual roots of scenario

importance of simplicity and manageability. Both benefits and obstacles to using scenarios in organizations are identified. Cognitive biases are examined as well, especially the well- known biases of overconfidence and the conjunction fallacy. Two experiments test the impact of scenarios on people's subjective confidence ranges. Another two experiments test

appears to lie in the exploitation of one set of biases (e.g., conjunction fallacies) to the internal coherence of subjects' beliefs. The psychological benefit of scenario planning counteract another (such as overconfidence).},

A basic for a methodology that helps the designer to master the interface between the abstract description of the function and the real layout of a technical system must be clear enough to fulfil this transfer without problems. However it must be global enough to be able to describe the complexity of any technical system. The method ought to be applicable for the analysis of an existing machine system as well as for the synthesis of an new one. The paper introduces a new methodological model -- the Element Model ``Contact {\&} Channel Model C{\&}CM'', ``Working Surface Pairs {\&} Cannel and Support Structures'' (Wirkfl{\"a}chenpaare {\&} Leitst{\"u}tzstrukturen WFP {\&} LSS) that has been developed at the Institute of Machine Design and Automotive Engineering of the University of Karlsruhe (TH), Germany (mkl). The fundamentals of this Element Model C{\&}CM are presented in their most important definitions and based on simple technical systems. Further the application within the scope of actual research projects is presented in order to show the strengths of the model on analysis as well as on synthesis of technical systems.},

Data on two very different types of software requirements were analyzed to determine what kinds of problems occur and whether these problems are important.

New software engineering techniques are clearly needed to improve both the development and statement of requirements.},

 abstract = {``In today's fast-paced, fiercely competitive world of commercial new product development, speed and flexibility are essential. Companies are increasingly realizing that the old, sequential approach to developing new products simply won't get the job done.'' (Takeuchi {\&} Nonaka, 1986)Now twenty-five years old, the statement from the 1986-edition of Harvard Business Review seems more true than ever before. Commercial markets are moving faster and faster, and time as a strategic source of competitive advantage is receiving increasing attention (Souza et al., 2004). This is the present condition for development teams -- and it is the point of departure for this research project. Heavy up-front planning represents a long management tradition in product development environments throughout the world. Gantt charts and Stage-Gate process models have become widely known industry standards and best practices. However, the basic concept of these defined process control models, which can be summarised as ``plan your work and work your plan'', often seems inappropriate when applied to development activities with just a small amount of uncertainty attached. This research project therefore seeks to investigate the use of a radically different and empirically based process control model originating from the domain of software development, namely the process framework called Scrum. Scrum as a process framework is often identified with the overall development paradigm coined as Agile Development and during the last decade it has gained a vast success in software development due to its lightweight character and efficient way of handling the challenges of increased market speed, change and product complexity. Now, traditional product development companies are beginning to discover the Scrum framework as a potential solution to their struggles with similar challenges.This Ph.D. project is based on case studies of the development environments of seven Danish companies working with the implementation of Scrum. The outcome of the project is an identification and overview of the challenges of implementing and conducting Scrum in physical product development experienced from both a design team$\backslash$textquoterights perspective and an organisational perspective.},

@article{Beard.2012,
 abstract = {Autonomous unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) are critical to current and future military, civil, and commercial operations. Despite their importance, no previous textbook has accessibly introduced UAVs to students in the engineering, computer, and science disciplines--until now. Small Unmanned Aircraftprovides a concise but comprehensive description of the key concepts and technologies underlying the dynamics, control, and guidance of fixed-wing unmanned aircraft, and enables all students with an introductory-level background in controls or robotics to enter this exciting and important area. The authors explore the essential underlying physics and sensors of UAV problems, including low-level autopilot for stability and higher-level autopilot functions of path planning. The textbook leads the student from rigid-body dynamics through aerodynamics, stability augmentation, and state estimation using onboard sensors, to maneuvering through obstacles. To facilitate understanding, the authors have replaced traditional homework assignments with a simulation project using the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Students begin by modeling rigid-body dynamics, then add aerodynamics and sensor models. They develop low-level autopilot code, extended Kalman filters for state estimation, path-following routines, and high-level path-planning algorithms. The final chapter of the book focuses on UAV guidance using machine vision. Designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in engineering or the sciences, this book offers a bridge to the aerodynamics and control of UAV flight. {\copyright} 2012 by Princeton University Press.

Prioritization is a crucial step towards making good decisions regarding product planning for single and multiple releases. Various aspects of functionality are considered, such as importance, risk, cost, etc. Prioritization decisions are made by stakeholders, including users, managers, developers, or their representatives. Methods are for combining individual prioritizations based on overall objectives and constraints. A range of different techniques and aspects are applied to an example to illustrate their use. Finally, limitations and shortcomings of current methods are pointed out, and open research questions in the area of requirements prioritization are discussed.},

@article{Brelje.2019,
 abstract = {Following high-profile government and industry studies, electric aircraft propulsion has emerged as an important research topic. This article surveys the scholarly and business literature on fixed-wing aircraft propelled in whole or in part by electricity. This includes all-electric, hybrid electric, and turboelectric architectures. We introduce a classification of electric aircraft, technology factors, and performance parameters. Next, we present an overview of electrical components and electric propulsion architectures. We survey existing commercial products, prototypes, demonstrators, and conceptual studies, and develop a list of potential benefits and disadvantages of electric propulsion with estimates of potential benefit. We present an introduction to power electronics, electric machines, and batteries for aircraft designers, and explore the emerging problem of aircraft thermal management. We review modeling, simulation, and multidisciplinary optimization capabilities, and identify current shortcomings. We conclude that the electric aircraft design problem introduces new coupling between previously distinct disciplines, such as aerodynamics and propulsion, which may only become apparent with high-fidelity, physics-based analysis. High-fidelity multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization of electric aircraft, including safety and economic analysis, remains an open challenge. {\copyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For ground based transportation, the system mass is relevant, but of relatively low importance. The paper addresses the application of electric propulsion systems in aeronautics, where all systems are much more constrained by their mass. After comparing different propulsion system architectures the focus is cast on the energy storage problem and here especially on battery storage systems. Using first order principles the limitations and required technology developments are demonstrated by introducing battery powered electric propulsion systems to small and medium sized aircraft.},

In this paper we sketch a provisional answer to these questions by first considering the reasoning pattern behind design thinking, and then enriching this picture by linking in key concepts from models of design activity and design thinking that have emerged over the last twenty years of design research.},

 abstract = {The personal and professional history of Vladimir Hubka is outlined. The scope of science leads to typical research methods for design, and the triad `theory -- subject -- method' connects a scientific or informal theory to a recommended method. Hubka initiated a body of formal scientific theory about technical systems, transformation processes, and engineering design processes. As a typical example, the development over time of the model of a transformation system is traced. The role of information is outlined, dividing it into object information and design process information, each with its theory and its applicable methods and heuristics. Engineering design science is placed into a hierarchy of sciences, the only developed design science.},

However, the existing functional decomposition methods for existing products have either a limitation of application scope or can not provide sufficiently comprehensive information. For these, an improved functional decomposition method based on function analysis system technique (called FAST) and the method of removal and operation is proposed. With the improved method, more information such as logical relationship of function, functional level, functional hierarchy and the relationship between function units and components can be got clearly, which are the important information for the conceptual design.

 abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in the military world over the last decade and the success of these military applications is increasingly driving efforts to establish unmanned aircraft in non-military roles. Introduction to UAV Systems, 4th edition provides a comprehensive introduction to all of the elements of a complete Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). It addresses the air vehicle, mission planning and control, several types of mission payloads, data links and how they interact with mission performance, and launch and recovery concepts. This book provides enough information to encourage a student to learn more; to provide a specialist with a basic appreciation of the technical issues that drive other parts of the system and interact with their specialty; or to help a program manager understand system-level tradeoffs and know what questions to ask. Key features: Comprehensive overview of all elements of a UAS and of how they interact. Introduces the underlying concepts of key subsystems. Emphasizes system-integration issues and how they relate to subsystem design choices. Practical discussion of issues informed by lessons learned in UAV programs. Introduction to UAV Systems, 4th edition is written both for newcomers to the subject and for experienced members of the UAV community who desire a comprehensive overview at the system level. As well as being a primary text for an introductory course on UAS or a supplementary text in a course that goes into more depth in one of the individual technologies involved in a UAS, this book is a useful overview for practicing engineers, researchers, managers, and consultants interested in UAV systems. {\copyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

 abstract = {For vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, the power needed for vertical take-off is much greater than the power needed for cruise. This power-matching problem can be solved with a balanced hybrid-electric propulsion system. However, there is a trade-off between take-off weight, wing loading, battery technology and range. This paper applies a new initial sizing algorithm for transitioning VTOL aircraft with hybrid-electric propulsion systems, including serial-hybrid and parallel-hybrid configurations. Exemplarily, a family of transitioning VTOL aircraft, intended for urban air mobility (air taxi) operations is designed. Results indicate that hybrid-electric propulsion systems must be considered for future mid-range VTOL aircraft. Very short missions favor fully electric propulsion systems, as this configuration avoids the complexity of a hybrid.},

Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach was first published in 1984 as a part of the Pitman series in Business and Public Policy. Its publication proved to be a landmark moment in the development of stakeholder theory. Widely acknowledged as a world leader in business ethics and strategic management, R. Edward Freeman's foundational work continues to inspire scholars and students concerned with a more practical view of how business and capitalism actually work.

@book{Hales.2004,
 abstract = {Engineering design concerns us all. In new products we expect higher quality, better reliability, lower cost, improved safety and more respect for the environment. The Design Manager is responsible for fulfilling these disparate and often mutually contradictory expectations, guiding the design team while liaising with and drawing support from project managers, manufacturers, marketing staff, customers and users. Design Managers and their teams will find the revised and expanded second edition of Managing Engineering Design to be a practical book providing a framework of precepts for the management of engineering design projects. Features include: jargon-free language with well-tried, real-world examples; useful tips for managers at the end of each chapter; a comprehensive bibliography at the end of the book. Managing Engineering Design is for design managers in industry, general managers with responsibility for design projects, and those training to become technical or design managers. It is also highly informative for graduate and undergraduate engineering students and ideally suited for establishing a web-based design management system for geographically dispersed teams. {\textquotedbl}This remarkable book, based on sound empirical research and design project experience, will be an enormous help to design managers and design engineers...{\textquotedbl} Professor Ken Wallace, University of Cambridge {\textquotedbl}The practical approach of Hales and Gooch particularly appealed to me... [they] manage to pull together a concise package of best practice in engineering management and successfully tie together the different activities that are often presented as unconnected. This is no minor feat and I lift my hat to them.{\textquotedbl} Doctor Roope Takala, Program Manager, Nokia Group.},

@article{HAUSER.1988,
 abstract = {Manufacturing companies striving to compete on quality must design products that not only are technically elegant and manufacturable but also reflect customers' desires and tastes. For optimal results, marketers, designers, engineers, and strategists should work closely together from product conception to end result. But what should an interfunctional team talk about? How can a team meeting get off the ground? Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, AT{\&}T, Ford, and other U.S. companies are using a Japanese innovation, the house of quality, to get things started. Presented here in clear, step-by-step exhibits, the house is a conceptual map on which an interfunctional team can display and organize the evidence it needs to set targets for design. The process begins with team members identifying the product attributes customers want, the team then ranks them in order of importance and measures them against the competition. Next, team members relate customer attributes to the engineering tasks involved. Engineers specify objective measures for each task and spell out how each influences the others--so everyone can see the complexity of any proposed improvement. Eventually, with all the relevant facts in view on the grid, the team makes its choices. The process has clarified opportunities, stimulated negotiation, and helped set an agenda. Once engineering targets have been set, the team can draw up new houses focusing on parts development, process operations, and production requirements. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

 abstract = {Creating innovative products is vital for the success of enterprises. Markets change constantly and force engineering departments to shorten innovation cycles. To be competitive, a methodical approach for systematic innovation is needed. One promising way to achieve this goal is to base development processes on functional modelling. In this paper, an overview of existing functional modelling approaches is laid out and advantages as well as disadvantages are discussed. Koller's methodology is presented in detail as it is highly suitable for systematic innovation. Although several methods seem to be published and well-documented, they currently are not widely adopted in industrial use. Reasons for this shortage are elaborated. An improved methodology for working with functions, physical effects and the morphological box is introduced. Different single aspects like disadvantages with the paper-based use of effect catalogues or the incorporation of magnitude influence with the composition of physical effects are shown. An implementation of a software prototype and its evolution is given. Thoughts on further improvement of both methodology and tool conclude the paper.},

 abstract = {Consideration of the environmental impact of aircraft has become critical in commercial aviation. The continued growth of air traffic has caused increasing demands to reduce aircraft emissions, imposing new constraints on the design and development of future airplane concepts. In this paper, an aircraft design optimisation framework is used to design aircraft that minimise specific environmental metrics. Multidisciplinary design optimisation is used to optimise aircraft by simultaneously considering airframe, engine and mission. The environmental metrics considered in this investigation are CO2 emissions - which are proportional to fuel burn - and landingtakeoff NO x emissions. The results are compared to those of an aircraft with minimum direct operating cost. The design variables considered in the optimisation problems include aircraft geometry, engine parameters, and cruise settings. An augmented Lagrangian particle swarm optimiser and a genetic algorithm are used to solve the single objective and multi-objective optimisation problems, respectively.},

If strides are to be made in the sciences, humanities, and arts, we must arrive at a far more detailed understanding of the creative process, its antecedents, and its inhibitors. This review, encompassing most subspecialties in the study of creativity and focusing on twenty-first-century literature, reveals both a growing interest in creativity among psychologists and a growing fragmentation in the field. To be sure, research into the psychology of creativity has grown theoretically and methodologically sophisticated, and researchers have made important contributions from an ever-expanding variety of disciplines. But this expansion has not come without a price. Investigators in one subfield often seem unaware of advances in another. Deeper understanding requires more interdisciplinary research, based on a systems view of creativity that recognizes a variety of interrelated forces operating at multiple levels.},

 abstract = {The crash of two 737 MAX passenger aircraft in late 2018 and early 2019, and subsequent grounding of the entire fleet of 737 MAX jets, turned a global spotlight on Boeing's practices and culture. Explanations for the crashes include: design flaws within the MAX's new flight control software system designed to prevent stalls; internal pressure to keep pace with Boeing's chief competitor, Airbus; Boeing's lack of transparency about the new software; and the lack of adequate monitoring of Boeing by the FAA, especially during the certification of the MAX and following the first crash. While these and other factors have been the subject of numerous government reports and investigative journalism articles, little to date has been written on the ethical significance of the accidents, in particular the ethical responsibilities of the engineers at Boeing and the FAA involved in designing and certifying the MAX. Lessons learned from this case include the need to strengthen the voice of engineers within large organizations. There is also the need for greater involvement of professional engineering societies in ethics-related activities and for broader focus on moral courage in engineering ethics education.},

First, we introduce general design theory, from which a descriptive model of design processes is derived. In this model, the concept of metamodels plays a crucial role in describing the evolutionary nature of design. Second, we show a cognitive design process model obtained by observing design processes using a protocol analysis method. We then discuss a computable model that can explain most parts of the cognitive model and also interpret the descriptive model. In the computable model, a design process is regarded as an iterative logical process realized by abduction, deduction, and circumscription. We implemented a design simulator that can trace design processes in which design specifications and design solutions are gradually revised as the design proceeds.},

@article{Horkoff.2019,
 abstract = {Over the last two decades, much attention has been paid to the area of goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE), where goals are used as a useful conceptualization to elicit, model, and analyze requirements, capturing alternatives and conflicts. Goal modeling has been adapted and applied to many sub-topics within requirements engineering (RE) and beyond, such as agent orientation, aspect orientation, business intelligence, model-driven development, and security. Despite extensive efforts in this field, the RE community lacks a recent, general systematic literature review of the area. In this work, we present a systematic mapping study, covering the 246 top-cited GORE-related conference and journal papers, according to Scopus. Our literature map addresses several research questions: we classify the types of papers (e.g., proposals, formalizations, meta-studies), look at the presence of evaluation, the topics covered (e.g., security, agents, scenarios), frameworks used, venues, citations, author networks, and overall publication numbers. For most questions, we evaluate trends over time. Our findings show a proliferation of papers with new ideas and few citations, with a small number of authors and papers dominating citations; however, there is a slight rise in papers which build upon past work (implementations, integrations, and extensions). We see a rise in papers concerning adaptation/variability/evolution and a slight rise in case studies. Overall, interest in GORE has increased. We use our analysis results to make recommendations concerning future GORE research and make our data publicly available.},

 abstract = {It is widely accepted in word-of-mouth (WOM) research that weak ties have a greater macro-level impact than strong ties on the spread of WOM and that marketers should thus intentionally stimulate WOM between weak ties to optimize a given WOM campaign. Here, we challenge this idea based on the fact that, in practice, marketers often incorporate a WOM campaign into other forms of marketing activities, typically advertising. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we demonstrate that while advertising serves as one source of information flow, the WOM that is most effective at driving product growth is created by strong rather than weak ties. The rationale behind this is simple: advertising competes against weak ties in disseminating information globally, and it is this global reach that has been widely considered the vital strength of weak ties over strong ties.},

Such a theory is useful as a foundation for a ratio nal approach to the engineering design process, as a background to engineering education, and other applications. The term {\textquotedbl}technical system{\textquotedbl} is used to represent all types of man-made artifacts, including technical products and processes. The technical system is therefore the subject (in the grammatical sense of the word) of the collection of activities which are performed by engineers within the processes of engineering design, including generating, retrieving, processing and transmitting of information about products. It is also the subject of various tasks in the production process, including work preparation and production planning, and in many economic considerations, company-internal and societal. In this way, the Theory of Technical Systems is a contribution to science, as in terpreted in the wider, Germanic sense of a {\textquotedbl}co-ordinated and codified body of knowledge{\textquotedbl}. It brings together the various viewpoints of engineers, scientists, economists, ergonomists, managers, users, sociologists, etc., and shows where and how they influence the forms of engineering products. It also explains the influ ences that a product exerts on its environment. This Theory of Technical Systems should thus interest design engineers, and en gineers involved in production, management, sales, etc. In an interdisciplinary ap plication of value analysis, the Theory of Technical Systems should provide answers to many questions raised in this field.},

@article{Kim.1997,
 abstract = {Why are some companies able to sustain high growth in revenues and profits--and others are not? To answer that question, the authors, both of INSEAD, spent five years studying more than 30 companies around the world. They found that the difference between the high-growth companies and their less successful competitors was in each group's assumptions about strategy. Managers of the less successful companies followed conventional strategic logic. Managers of the high-growth companies followed what the authors call the logic of value innovation. Conventional strategic logic and value innovation differ along the basic dimensions of strategy. Many companies take their industry's conditions as given; value innovators don't. Many companies let competitors set the parameters of their strategic thinking; value innovators do not use rivals as benchmarks. Rather than focus on the differences among customers, value innovators look for what customers value in common. Rather than view opportunities through the lens of existing assets and capabilities, value innovators ask, What if we start anew? The authors tell the story of the French hotelier Accor, which discarded the notion of what a hotel is supposed to look like in order to offer what most customers want: a good night's sleep at a low price. And Virgin Atlantic challenged industry conventions by eliminating first-class service and channeling savings into innovations for business-class passengers. Those companies didn't set out to build advantages over the competition, but they ended up achieving the greatest competitive advantages.},

@article{Komoto.2012,
 abstract = {Conceptual design of modern products has become complex due to an increasing number of subsystems and components comprising the system and the multi-disciplinarity of the employed design knowledge. The paper proposes a product modeling framework and a CAD system for conceptual design of complex products focusing on hierarchical system decomposition and consistency management of design information across different engineering disciplines. The framework and CAD system support these tasks with concurrent development of functional and parameter-level product descriptions and comprehensive evaluation of these descriptions from functional, parameter-level, structural, and behavioral aspects. A conceptual design case at a printer manufacturer is demonstrated.},

Lessons learned from actual DoD programs that have employed and are employing Agile are provided as well as information gleaned from the myriad articles and books available on Agile. While this report does not pretend to cover every paper or thought published about Agile in the DoD world, it provides an overview of some challenges in using Agile; an overview of how some programs have addressed these challenges; and some additional recommendations on dealing with these challenges. The intended audience is policy makers, program office staff, and software development contractors who are contemplating proposing the use of Agile software development methods. It is the hope of the authors that this paper stimulates discussion about and appropriate adoption of Agile in the DoD world. We hope to obtain further data so that our list of considerations can be updated and expanded for use by all practitioners.},

@phdthesis{Leonhardsberger.,
 abstract = {Durch den zivilen Einsatz von unbemannten Luftfahrzeugen konnten in den letzten Jahren vielf{\"a}ltige Aufgabenstellungen effizienter, {\"o}konomischer und umweltfreundlicher durchgef{\"u}hrt werden. Der Einsatz von unbemannten Luftfahrzeugen zum Transport von Fracht stellt dabei ein immer wieder angedachtes Anwendungsfeld dar. Der zivile Transport von Fracht mit einer Gesamtmasse von etwa einer Tonne mit einem unbemannten Luftfahrzeug {\"u}ber mehrere hundert Kilometer ist in dieser Form weltweit neuartig. Die Betriebskostenstruktur stellt f{\"u}r eine Transportl{\"o}sung ein wesentliches Merkmal dar. Neben den Eigenschaften Transportdauer und Zuverl{\"a}ssigkeit hat sie letztendlich gro{\ss}en Einfluss hinsichtlich des Nutzens und der Wirtschaftlichkeit der Transportl{\"o}sung. Die Betriebskostenstruktur steht in Interaktion mit einer Vielzahl von externen (nicht beeinflussbaren) und internen (beeinflussbaren) Faktoren. Eine solide Absch{\"a}tzung des Marktpotentials, die Identifikation realistischer Einsatzszenarien und die kostenorientierte technische Ausgestaltung des Flugger{\"a}tes machen eine (fr{\"u}hzeitige) Absch{\"a}tzung der Betriebskosten daher unabdingbar. Die vorliegende Arbeit liefert ein Kostenmodell zur Absch{\"a}tzung der Betriebskosten unter verschiedenen Rahmenbedingungen und erm{\"o}glicht so erste quantitative Aussagen {\"u}ber die zu erwartenden Kosten. Der hohen Komplexit{\"a}t der Thematik wird durch eine kombinierte quantitative und qualitative Betrachtung Rechnung getragen. Besonderes Augenmerk liegt dabei auf einer m{\"o}glichst gesamtheitlichen Modellierung. Das Kostenmodell ber{\"u}cksichtigt dabei eine Vielzahl an Faktoren, resultierend aus Markt, Technologie sowie regulatorischen und rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen. Die vorliegende Arbeit st{\"u}tzt sich daf{\"u}r auf die Kostentr{\"a}gerst{\"u}ckrechnung und auf die Methodik des Concept Mapping um die komplexe Zusammenh{\"a}nge der Kostentr{\"a}gerrechnung darstellen zu k{\"o}nnen. Durch konkrete Anwendungsbeispiele konnte die grunds{\"a}tzliche Eignung des Modells demonstriert werden. Die gro{\ss}e Brandbreite der quantitativen Ergebnisse der drei Szenarien zeigt gleichzeitig das gr{\"o}{\ss}te Problem der Kostenabsch{\"a}tzung zum derzeitigen Zeitpunkt: Die relativ hohe Anzahl der undefinierten Rahmenbedingungen l{\"a}sst eine quantitative Kostenabsch{\"a}tzung nur unter eine Vielzahl von Annahmen zu. Der Vergleich mit den stra{\ss}engebundenen Transportmitteln hat gezeigt, dass die Transportkosten, auch im {\glqq}Best-Case-Szenario{\grqq}, um ein Vielfaches h{\"o}her sind. Erst bei weiterer technischer Entwicklung und einer damit einhergehenden Reduktion der Kosten ist an einen wirtschaftlichen Betrieb zu denken.},

@article{Nguyen.2013,
 abstract = {This paper presents the findings of a study conducted in 2010 by the NASA Innovation Fund Award project entitled {\textquotedbl}Elastically Shaped Future Air Vehicle Concept{\textquotedbl}. The study presents three themes in support of meeting national and global aviation challenges of reducing fuel burn for present and future aviation systems. The first theme addresses the drag reduction goal through innovative vehicle configurations via non-planar wing optimization. Two wing candidate concepts have been identified from the wing optimization: a drooped wing shape and an inflected wing shape. The drooped wing shape is a truly biologically inspired wing concept that mimics a seagull wing and could achieve about 5{\%} to 6{\%} drag reduction, which is aerodynamically significant. From a practical perspective, this concept would require new radical changes to the current aircraft development capabilities for new vehicles with futuristic-looking wings such as this concept. The inflected wing concepts could achieve between 3{\%} to 4{\%} drag reduction. While the drag reduction benefit may be less, the inflected-wing concept could have a near-term impact since this concept could be developed within the current aircraft development capabilities. The second theme addresses the drag reduction goal through a new concept of elastic wing shaping control. By aeroelastically tailoring the wing shape with active control to maintain optimal aerodynamics, a significant drag reduction benefit could be realized. A significant reduction in fuel burn for long-range cruise from elastic wing shaping control could be realized. To realize the potential of the elastic wing shaping control concept, the third theme emerges that addresses the drag reduction goal through a new aerodynamic control effector called a variable camber continuous trailing edge flap. Conventional aerodynamic control surfaces are discrete independent surfaces that cause geometric discontinuities at the trailing edge region. These discontinuities promote vorticities which result in drag rises as well as noise sources. The variable camber trailing edge flap concept could provide a substantial drag reduction benefit over a conventional discrete flap system. Aerodynamic simulations show a drag reduction of over 50{\%} could be achieved with the flap concept over a conventional discrete flap system.},

@article{Panigrahi.2021,
 abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have slowly but steadily emerged as a research and commercial hotspot because of their widespread applications. Due to their agility, compact size, and ability to integrate multiple sensors, they are mostly sought for applications that require supplementing human effort in risky and monotonous missions. Despite all of these advantages, rotorcrafts, in general, are limited by their endurance and power-intensive flight requirements, which consequently affect the time of flight and operational range. On the other hand, fixed-wing aircrafts have an extended range, as the entire thrust force is along the direction of motion and are inherently more stable but are limited by their takeoff and landing strip requirements. One of the potential solutions to increase the endurance of VTOL rotorcrafts (Vertical Take-Off and Landing Vehicles) was to exploit the thrust vectoring ability of the individual actuators in multi-rotors, which would enable take-off and hovering as a VTOL vehicle and flight as a fixed-wing aircraft. The primary aim of this paper is to lay out the overall design process of a Hybrid VTOL tilt-rotor UAV from the initial conceptual sketch to the final fabricated prototype. The novelty of the design lies in achieving thrust vectoring capabilities in a fixed-wing platform with minimum actuation and no additional control complexity. This paper presents novel bi-copter that has been designed to perform as a hybrid configuration in both VTOL and fixed wing conditions with minimum actuators in comparison to existing designs. The unified dynamic modelling along with the approximation of multiple aerodynamic coefficients by numerical simulations is also presented. The overall conceptual design, dynamic modeling, computational simulation, and experimental analysis of the novel hybrid fixed-wing bi-copter with thrust vectoring capabilities aiming to substantially increase the flight range and endurance compared to the conventional aircraft rotorcraft configurations are presented.},

 abstract = {The European Flightpath 2050 and corresponding Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) as well as the NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation N+ series have elaborated aggressive emissions and external noise reduction targets according to chronological waypoints. In order to deliver ultra-low or even zero in-flight emissions levels, there exists an increasing amount of international research and development emphasis on electrification of the propulsion and power systems of aircraft. Since the late 1990s, a series of experimental and a host of burgeouning commercial activities for fixed-wing aviation have focused on glider, ultra-light and light-sport airplane, and this is proving to serve as a cornerstone for more ambitious transport aircraft design and integration technical approaches. The introduction of hybrid-electric technology has dramatically expanded the design space and the full-potential of these technologies will be drawn through synergetic, tightly-coupled morphological and systems integration emphasizing propulsion - as exemplified by the potential afforded by distributed propulsion solutions. With the aim of expanding upon the current repository of knowledge associated with hybrid-electric propulsion systems a quad-fan arranged narrow-body transport aircraft equipped with two advanced Geared-Turbofans (GTF) and two Electrical Fans (EF) in an under-wing podded installation is presented in this technical article. The assessment and implications of an increasing Degree-of-Hybridization for Useful Power (HP,USE) on the overall sizing, performance as well as flight technique optimization of fuel-battery hybrid-electric aircraft is addressed herein. The integrated performance of the concept was analyzed in terms of potential block fuel burn reduction and change in vehicular efficiency in comparison to a suitably projected conventional aircraft employing GTF-only propulsion targeting year 2035. Results showed that by increasing HP,USE, significant fuel burn reduction can be achieved; however, this also proves to be detrimental in terms of vehicular efficiency. The potential in block fuel reduction diminishes with increasing design range - especially for low battery gravimetric specific energies. In addition, the narrow shape of the fuselage represents a volumetric constraint for the storage of the battery and typical cargo. It was concluded that the short-range/regional market segment would be the most suited for the application of such concepts. Concerning the influence of HP,USE on flight technique optimization, an increasing HP,USE was found to have a tendency of decreasing the optimum flight speed and altitude. Further investigation of more synergistic design and integration of the hybrid-electric motive power system needs to be conducted in order to explore the full benefit of such technologies. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

@book{Riezler.1996,
 abstract = {In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird eine in Wissenschaft und Unternehmungspraxis ak tuelle und lebhaft diskutierte Problemstellung aufgegriffen. Mit zunehmender Auto matisierung von Produktionsprozessen werden bei Serienproduktion bereits im Pro duktentwicklungsstadium die fiir die sp{\"a}tere Kostenentstehung ma{\ss}gebenden Einflu{\ss} gr{\"o}{\ss}en und Bedingungen weitgehend festgelegt. Gleichzeitig mit der Bestimmung von Produktart und -eigenschaften werden Qualit{\"a}t und spezifische Verbrauchsmengen der Erzeugniseinsatzstoffe sowie vielfach auch wesentliche Teile der Proze{\ss}bedingungen mit den notwendigen Fertigungsanlagen und Betriebsstoffverbr{\"a}uchen geplant. Daraus folgt eine weitreichende Vorfixierung der Mengenkomponenten der Herstellkosten. {\"U}ber die Produktqualit{\"a}t werden zugleich die Absatzm{\"o}glichkeiten in den relevanten M{\"a}rkten und damit die Erl{\"o}se wesentlich mitbestimmt. Damit sind bei der Neugestal tung von Gro{\ss}serienprodukten zumeist {\"u}ber 80 {\%} der Erfolgskomponenten bereits in der Produktentstehungsphase - also vor der Markteinf{\"u}hrung - betriebswirtschaftlich zu bewerten und weitgehend bindende Entscheidungen dar{\"u}ber zu f{\"a}llen. Der Verfasser untersucht, inwieweit die vorhandenen Instrumente des internen Rech nungswesens geeignet sind, die unter diesen Bedingungen vorherrschenden Planungs-, Entscheidungs-, Steuerungs- und {\"U}berwachungsaufgaben betriebswirtschaftlich zu unterst{\"u}tzen und wie bestehende M{\"a}ngel durch Weiterentwicklungen des Instrumen tariums beseitigt werden k{\"o}nnen. Dabei betrachtet er Produktentwicklung, -herstellung und -vertrieb sowie -entsorgung als ein komplexes Projekt mit individueller Lebens dauer. Sein Ziel ist es daher, eine Lebenszyklusrechnung als Instrument des Pro jektcontrolling aufzubauen. F{\"u}r deren Ausgestaltung steht die Neueinf{\"u}hrung eines Serienprodukts als Projekttyp im Mittelpunkt, die wesentlichen Ergebnisse sind aber auf andere strategische Projekte {\"u}bertragbar.},

@misc{Schuh.2021b,
 abstract = {Door-to-door travel time within the European Union shall be reduced to less than four hours for 90 percent of all travelers, according to the goals of {\textquotedbl}Flightpath 2050{\textquotedbl}. Point-to-point thin-haul connections provided by air taxis can help to achieve this goal, as analyzed by academia, and envisioned by start-ups like the German e.SAT or the Swiss Dufour. To further examine the market potential for air taxis within Germany, a sophisticated transport model was set up comparing door-to-door travel times and cost for the established transport modes train, car, and CS-25 aircraft with a novel air taxi service capable of utilizing local CS-23 airfields. Moreover, important parameters for the success of air taxi services are analyzed in depth. For the purpose of this study, a piloted 5-seater aircraft with a required take-off distance of less than 800 m was considered and a reasonable price range for business trips comparable to a first-class train service ticket was investigated. In addition to existing analyses, this study also uses real-world data for train services and actually serviced routes of CS-25 aircraft. A figure for the state-of-the-art traffic volume and trip distribution on district level in Germany was adapted from the Traffic Interconnection Forecast 2030 of the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI). For these existing transport modes plus the proposed air taxi service, travel time and travel costs are calculated for each particular route using statistical models. Assuming a constant number of gross travelers on each route, the mode choices for each route are redistributed according to the value of travel time saved (VoTTS) and the according distribution of passengers willingness to pay for time savings. Results show that travel time on certain routes can be shortened by 50 percent resulting in an air taxi demand of at least 5000 air taxis overall. Market share, however, is strongly dependent on assumed price per kilometer. Hence, if industry can achieve a cost-level comparable to a first-class train ticket, a significant market share potential for air taxi services of 2.7 {\%} of all business travel is forecasted by this study.},

@article{Schuh.2021c,
 abstract = {Established transport modes are reaching increasingly both capacity and infrastructure limits. To satisfy transport demand for passengers and cargo in the future, an increased usage of the third dimension could be one solution. More than 100 design concepts for so called {\textquotedbl}air taxis{\textquotedbl} that shall address the markets for urban and regional air mobility are currently under development. This study supports the development efforts by providing a clear picture of top-level specifications for such vehicles and measures to assess their formal, technical, and economic coherence. Top-level specifications include a clear definition of a reference mission, top-level aircraft requirements (TLARs), and main components. All elements are adapted to the special requirements of either urban or regional air mobility, if necessary, and are fitted into the common aircraft design process suggested by literature. As vehicle designs for urban and regional air mobility are guided by diverse technical concepts, five archetypes are introduced that mainly differ regarding the way lift and propulsion are generated. Based on a functional dissection of those archetypes, main components of air taxis were defined to serve as part of a reference frame for top-level specifications. TLARs are frequently discussed within academia. However, there is neither a clear definition which categories shall be covered, nor a distinction between vehicles for urban and regional air mobility. This study addresses both issues by defining sets of top-level aircraft requirements and main components as a framework for top-level specifications and inserting them into a validation framework. This enables full validation of a complete specification of a given air-taxi, to check coherence to formal, technical and economic requirements. Results are validated with the Silent Air Taxi, a piloted five-seater aircraft currently developed by German start-up e.SAT GmbH.},

But Scrum's simplicity itself---its lack of prescription---can be disarming, and new practitioners often find themselves reverting to old project management habits and tools and yielding lesser results. In this illuminating series of case studies, Scrum co-creator and evangelist Ken Schwaber identifies the real-world lessons---the successes and failures---culled from his years of experience coaching companies in agile project management. Through them, you'll understand how to use Scrum to solve complex problems and drive better results---delivering more valuable software faster.

Two distinct classes of vehicles are reviewed; Hypersonic Transports and Space Launchers, their common features and differences are examined. After a brief historical overview, the paper takes a multi-disciplinary approach to these vehicles, discusses various design aspects, and technical challenges. Operational issues are explored, including mission profiles, current and predicted markets, in addition to environmental effects and human factors. Technological issues are also reviewed, focusing on the three major challenge areas associated with these vehicles: aerothermodynamics, propulsion, and structures. In addition, matters of reliability and maintainability are also presented. The paper also reviews the certification and flight testing of these vehicles from a global perspective. Finally the current stakeholders in the field of hypersonic flight are presented, summarizing the active programs and promising concepts. {\copyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

@book{Taura.2013,
 abstract = {The concept generation process seems like an intuitional thought: difficult to capture and perform, although everyone is capable of it. It is not an analytical process but a synthetic process which has yet to be clarified. Furthermore, new research methods for investigating the concept generation process-a very difficult task since the concept generation process is driven by inner feelings deeply etched in the mind-are necessary to establish its theory and methodology.  Concept Generation for Design Creativity-A Systematized Theory and Methodology presents the concept generation process both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, the concept generation process is discussed by comparing metaphor, abduction, and General Design Theory from the perspective of similarities and dissimilarities. Property mapping, concept blending, and concept integration in thematic relation have been explained methodologically. So far, these theories and methods have been discussed independently, and the relations among them have not been clarified. Two newly developed research methods to investigate the concept generation process are clearly explained: extended protocol analysis and constructive simulation.  By reading Concept Generation for Design Creativity-A Systematized Theory and Methodology, students, researchers and lecturers in design disciplines (including engineering design, industrial design, software design, CHI, design education, and cognitive science) can obtain a clear picture of the advanced research findings and the outline of the theories and methods for concept generation. Furthermore, readers are expected to achieve the competence to generate new concepts.},

@article{Thew.2018,
 abstract = {'Socio-political' issues, such as emotions, values and people's feelings, are often cited as problems in the RE process. A method is described for analysing such issues. The method consists of a taxonomy of stakeholders' values, motivations and emotions (VME), with process guidance for eliciting and analysing these issues for the RE process and design implications. Values are personal attitudes or long-term beliefs which may influence stakeholder functional and non-functional requirements. Motivations are psychological constructs related to personality traits which may be viewed as stakeholders' long-term goals in RE. Emotions are cues to stakeholders' reactions arising from value/motivation conflicts. The method is supported by a website which illustrates the taxonomy with explanations and scenarios describing problems arising from value conflicts, and from poor understanding of stakeholder values. Two method validation studies were undertaken: first, an evaluation of the website and method by novices and RE experts; and second, case study applications of RE value analysis in real-world industrial practice. The method was used by all practitioners, although in different ways, some used it to create an agenda of issues for analysis while others employed the VMEs to interpret stakeholders' views and manage stakeholder negotiations. The validation studies provide evidence for the acceptability of the method for industrial practitioners, illustrating how value-related problems are identified and analysed effectively by the method. The utility of analysing VMEs is compared to other 'socio-political issues'-oriented methods in RE and methods which focus on monetized values in product requirements.},

@article{Thoring.2011,
 abstract = {This article presents a formal model of the design thinking process based on Method Engineering.  The foundation of our work is based on observations within an educational context - the 'School of Design Thinking' of the Hasso-Plattner-Institute in Potsdam, Germany ({\textquotedbl}HPI D-School{\textquotedbl}).  We analyzed athe design thinking process, as it is practiced there, and developed a process model that describes all process steps in detail, as well as the respective input and output of each phase.  A particular emphasis is given to the question, when to iterate in the process.  The process model presented in this article contributes to a better understanding of design thinking, especially for educators, companies, and design practitioners.  In detail, it could be used to better analyze design thinking projects and adjust them for specific companies or situations, to compare design thinking with other methods (design process models), and to develop IT-based solutions to support and facilitate the design thinking process itself or parts of it},

 abstract = {A single-aisle commercial transport concept with a turboelectric propulsion system architecture was developed assuming entry into service in 2035 and compared to a similar technology conventional configuration. The turboelectric architecture consisted of two underwing turbofans with generators extracting power from the fan shaft and sending it to a rear fuselage, axisymmetric, boundary layer ingesting fan. Results indicate that the turbo- electric concept has an economic mission fuel burn reduction of 7{\%}, and a design mission fuel burn reduction of 12{\%} compared to the conventional configuration. An exploration of the design space was performed to better understand how the turboelectric architecture changes the design space, and system sensitivities were run to determine the sensitivity of thrust specific fuel consumption at top of climb and propulsion system weight to the motor power, fan pressure ratio, and electrical transmission efficiency of the aft boundary layer ingesting fan. {\copyright} 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA .

is an approach to requirements engineering dealing with intentionality in accordance with the relations among different actors.

This paper presents an conceptual analysis comparing characteristics of those methods giving examples related to actors' relations definition, goal organizational model, tasks

representation, risk analysis, and non-functional requirements. The aim of this work is to show both frameworks benefits and drawbacks. We believe that this analysis helps the understanding of the core concepts of GORE as well as it draws attention to key representation issues for both KAOS and i*.},

@article{Yuan.2016,
 abstract = {ABSTRACTMultidisciplinary complex mechatronic systems span disciplines such as mechanics, electronics, control and software. Increasing complexity makes the implementation of automated design for complex mechatronics highly challenging. An effective method for decomposing an overall function to obtain the function structure and principle solution is needed for efficient creative design. A hybrid approach is proposed to automate the process of functional decomposition which contains three main steps. First, an overall function is decomposed to several functional effects automatically based on qualitative processing reasoning. Then the physical effect decomposition is conducted for each functional effect based on the support functions. For the functions for which a suitable physical effect cannot be found, a backward search decomposition is proposed to find a multichain function network for it. The decomposition process is implemented with SysML, and illustrated through an automobile engine example. An analysis is given to show the performance of the proposed method.},
